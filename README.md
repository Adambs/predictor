# The Python Argument Clinic

Welcome to the Argument Clinic! This project is a playful command-line application designed to simulate an argument by responding to user inputs with witty and challenging retorts, enriched with machine learning (ML) associations. The goal is to create an engaging and humorous experience that encourages users to think creatively while interacting with the automated response system.

## Features

- **Rule-Based Responses**: The core of the Argument Clinic is a set of rules that determine responses based on user input.
- **Keyword Recognition**: Implemented keyword detection to trigger specific responses.
- **Randomized Retorts**: For a less predictable and more engaging interaction, the clinic uses a pool of responses from which it randomly selects.
- **Argument Length**: The user can specify how long the argument should last.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management
